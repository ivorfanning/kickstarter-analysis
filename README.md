# kickstarter-analysis
*Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends*

### Project Overview
*The main purpose of this project is to help the playwright Louise to analyse how to prepare her crowdfunding $10,000 successfully, by analysing the Kickstarter dataset.*

### Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis
*Due to the large set of data, the analysis of the destination is focused on US, and of the similar event for crowdfunding is in theater.
Overall, the successful rate of funding $10,000 is around 55%, and in US the goal $10,000 it is almost double the average of funding goal and pledged. In the subcategory “Theater/plays”, the successful rate is around 61.4%.*
#### Challenges
*The possible challenges are following:
1. The time span of this dataset is huge, from 1970 to 2017.
2. The latest data is from 2017, and the prediction is not accurate.
3. The goal needs to be adjusted a bit lower than expected due to the successful rate, Louise might need to revise the expense.*
### Results

#### Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
![Outcomes_Vs_Launch Date](https://github.com/ivorfanning/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
*1. From the entire data, the number of successful crowdfunding of theater is higher than the failed and canceled campaign in every month.
2. The best crowdfunding campaign timing is in May and June.*
#### One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals
![Outcomes_Vs_Goals](https://github.com/ivorfanning/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_Vs_Goals.png)
*The most successful crowdfunding campaign is the goal under $1000, the higher the goal set, the lower the successful percentage. So, the successful percentage of crowdfunding is negative corelated with the goal.*
#### limitations of the dataset and recommendations
*The time span of this dataset is huge, from 1970 to 2017 and the latest   data is from 2017, and the prediction is not accurate.
The recommendation for another table is to get the preference of what kind of campaign purpose and how much they could donate for different age of group people.*
